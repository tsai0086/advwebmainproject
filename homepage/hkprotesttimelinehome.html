<span class="article_preview">A second protest in response to the suspected tear gas leak occurred at night. More than 70 people, mostly Tuen Mun residents, were arrested. Man Shek Fong-yau, a former police constable who organised several pro-Beijing events, appeared outside the Tai Hing Operational Base at 8:30 pm with around 30 people. The group chanted the slogan "Hong Kong cockroaches, the vermin of the times", a play on the pro-democracy slogan "Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times", and was seen arguing with residents. Residents refused to leave after police raised a blue warning flag stating that they were engaged in an unlawful assembly. Several black-clad protesters began to form roadblocks 20 minutes later.

Police ordered residents to kneel down with their hands in the air or behind their backs at the lobby of Yat Sang House, Siu Hin Court. A man and a woman who appeared to taunt the police entered a Japanese restaurant in the area when officers tried to chase them. Two of the restaurant's shopkeepers refused to allow the police to enter the restaurant to arrest the pair. The police then pulled the shopkeepers out of the restaurant and arrested them, then ordered the original suspects to show their identification documents. At around midnight, protesters hurled petrol bombs at the police base, and the police responded by firing three bean bag rounds from inside the base.</span><span class="more"> More...</span><br><br>
